# Digital-Diary
A diary is a record (originally in handwritten format) with discrete entries arranged by date reporting on what has happened  over the course of a day or other period. A personal diary may include a person's experiences, and/or thoughts or feelings,  including comments on current events outside the writer's direct experience. Someone who keeps a diary is known as a diarist.
